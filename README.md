# Swan Customer Retention Project ðŸ¦¢

## About the Project

This project was undertaken to predict the likelihood of customers cancelling their mobile phone contracts in order to find target areas for marketing to improve retention. Data, individuals and companies used are hypothetical.
We participated in this project as a means to enhance our predictive modelling skills, particularly in classification modelling and to gain a practical understanding of these methods.

## Goals

- Produce multiple models through different methods to determine the likelihood of a customer leaving. Models to develop are:
  - Logisitc Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Develop a list of at-risk customers for the company to target marketing campaigns towards
- Create an information deck detailing our findings, including:
  - Key reasons for customers leaving
  - Lost customer demographics
  - Areas to target
