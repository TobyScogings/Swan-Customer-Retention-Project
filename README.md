# Swan Customer Retention Project ü¶¢

A project by team "Santa Tech" as a proof of concept for logistic regression, decision tree and random forest modelling.

## About the Project üåü

This project was undertaken to predict the likelihood of customers cancelling their mobile phone contracts in order to find target areas for marketing to improve retention. Data, individuals and companies used are hypothetical.
We participated in this project as a means to enhance our predictive modelling skills, particularly in classification modelling and to gain a practical understanding of these methods.

## Goals üéØ

- Produce multiple models through different methods to determine the likelihood of a customer leaving. Models to develop are:
  - Logisitc Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
- Develop a list of at-risk customers for the company to target marketing campaigns towards
- Create an information deck detailing our findings, including:
  - Key reasons for customers leaving
  - Lost customer demographics
  - Areas to target

## Technologies Used üñ•Ô∏è

- `python`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `ydf`
- Microsoft Powerpoint
- Microsoft Excel

## Project Structure üîÄ

- **Data Handling and Exploration**: Data was taken from "Project Data.csv" and explored to prepare for modelling
- **Model Creation**: All three models were create in tandem by different team members then collated after completion
- **Success Analysis**: Key metrics were considered (accuracy and recall) and iterated upon until maximised
- **Output Generation**: Once models were finalised, a weighted formula determined the deliverable list of customer risks.
- **Information Deck Development**: Running alongside these steps was an info deck, used to describe our findings and give suggestions for improvement.

## Outcomes üéâ

*Technical*:

- "santa_tech_full_predictions.xlsx" and "santa_tech_top_500.xlsx" show our lists of customers and their risk of leaving
- A readable information deck detailing the success and pain points to assist marketing campaigns

*Personal*:

- Learn practical implementations of modelling techniques
- Practice creating deliverables in a new format
- Strengthen python techniques
